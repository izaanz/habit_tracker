# Habit Tracker

Having good habits leads to a healthy and successful lifestyle. However, developing and maintaining good habits is indeed a challenge hence, a good habit tracker can serve as an assistant for maintaining, keeping track of, and principally viewing your progress.

This Habit Tracker will take all your data and progress headache away giving you more time to work on your habits. The program is a part of *IU University's* *DLBDSOOFPP01* course and uses Python 3.8 as the backend of the program.


## Habit Tracker's Core Functionality
The habit tracker essentially allows a user to:

* Add habit 
* Remove habit or category 
* Define Periodicity of habits (Daily, weekly, and monthly)
* Add Habit Category for habit reference
* Mark your habit as completed

### Progress and Streak Tracker
Additionally, the user can view:
* View all of their created habits
* View all of their created habits for a specific period
* View streaks of all habits
* View the longest streak of specific habit
* View streak history of specific habit
